  This is a simple React project, so I didn't face any challenges. It took some time. First, I designed the font site using Tailwind CSS, and then I created demo JSON data. After that, I fetched the data and displayed it in cards using the map method. Then, I added some important features. I am very happy to have developed this kind of website. Thank you for reading this! 😊🙏
